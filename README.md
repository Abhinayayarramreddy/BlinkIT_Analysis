**Blinkit Sales Analysis**

This project analyzes sales data using Python to uncover insights on how product characteristics and outlet features impact overall sales performance.
It uses visualization libraries to create KPI summaries and comparative charts for better business understanding.

**KPI’s Requirements**
Total Sales: The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
Average Sales: The average revenue per sale.
Number of Items: The total count of different items sold.
Average Rating: The average customer rating for items sold. 

**Chart’s Requirements**
1. Total Sales by Fat Content:
	Objective: Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.
	Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.

	Chart Type: Donut Chart.

3. Total Sales by Item Type:
	Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.
	Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.

	Chart Type: Bar Chart.

5. Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales:
	Objective: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.
	Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.

	Chart Type: Stacked Column Chart.

7. Total Sales by Outlet Establishment:
	Objective: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.

	Chart Type: Line Chart.

9. Sales by Outlet Size:
	Objective: Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.

	Chart Type: Donut/ Pie Chart.

11. Sales by Outlet Location:
	Objective: Assess the geographic distribution of sales across different locations.

	Chart Type: Bar chart.

**Tools & Libraries:**

Python 3.x
Pandas – Data cleaning and aggregation
NumPy – Numerical computations
Matplotlib – Data visualization
Seaborn – Advanced and aesthetic plots

**Outcome:**

This notebook effectively demonstrates how Python can be used to perform data-driven sales analysis 
and build visual insights without Power BI or Excel, relying solely on data manipulation and visualization libraries.
